# sinc_interpolation

An R-script (sinc_interpolation.R) with the sinc function and the sinc interpolation function. The sinc interpolation function can be used to generate high-resolved temperature data from sparse measurements

Includes a step-by-step guide for employing sinc interpolation over environmental temperature (or other) data, with figures along the way. Utilized some data from temperature.txt.
